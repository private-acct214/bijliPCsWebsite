        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to Precision Systems. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and services. By using our services, you agree to these Terms.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <p>Precision Systems provides custom PC building, technology deployment, and related services. The specific terms of any project will be outlined in your quote or service agreement.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Quotes and Orders</h2>
        <h3>Quote Validity</h3>
        <p>Quotes are valid for 14 days from the date issued unless otherwise specified. Component prices may fluctuate, and we reserve the right to adjust pricing if significant changes occur before order confirmation.</p>
        
        <h3>Order Confirmation</h3>
        <p>An order is confirmed when we receive your deposit and written approval of the quote. Once confirmed, changes may incur additional fees or restocking charges.</p>
        
        <h3>Deposits and Payment</h3>
        <p>A 50% deposit is required before we order parts. The remaining balance is due upon project completion, before pickup or delivery. We accept [payment methods]. Business clients may arrange alternate payment terms by request.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Warranties</h2>
        <h3>Labor Warranty</h3>
        <p>We provide a limited labor warranty on our assembly and configuration work, typically 30-90 days depending on the project type. This covers defects in our workmanship but does not cover:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Physical damage or misuse</li>
          <li>Software issues unrelated to our configuration</li>
          <li>Damage from power surges or environmental factors</li>
          <li>Modifications made by others</li>
          <li>Customer-supplied components</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Component Warranties</h3>
        <p>All components carry their original manufacturer warranties. We will assist with warranty claims during our labor warranty period and can provide paid assistance thereafter.</p>
        
        <h3>Customer-Supplied Parts</h3>
        <p>Parts supplied by the customer are not covered by our labor warranty. We will inspect for compatibility but cannot guarantee the condition or functionality of parts we did not source.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Delivery and Pickup</h2>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>Estimated completion times are provided in good faith but are not guaranteed. Delays may occur due to part availability, shipping issues, or other factors beyond our control.</p>
        
        <h3>Local Pickup</h3>
        <p>Systems must be picked up within 14 days of completion notification. We will attempt to contact you multiple times. After 30 days, storage fees may apply.</p>
        
        <h3>Delivery</h3>
        <p>Delivery is available within our service area for an additional fee. Risk of loss transfers to you upon delivery. We recommend inspecting your system immediately upon receipt.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
        <h3>Before Parts Are Ordered</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your order before we order parts for a full refund of your deposit, minus a reasonable consultation fee.</p>
        
        <h3>After Parts Are Ordered</h3>
        <p>Cancellations after parts are ordered are subject to restocking fees (typically 15-25%) and any non-refundable costs we have incurred.</p>
        
        <h3>Completed Systems</h3>
        <p>We do not offer refunds on completed, functional systems that meet the agreed specifications. If there is an issue with your system, please contact us to discuss warranty service.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our liability is limited to the amount you paid for the specific service at issue</li>
          <li>We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages</li>
          <li>We are not liable for data loss — you are responsible for backing up your data</li>
          <li>We are not liable for delays or failures due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or our services will be resolved through good-faith negotiation. If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, it will be subject to binding arbitration in [Your State/Jurisdiction].</p>
        
        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes apply to orders placed after the update date. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.</p>
