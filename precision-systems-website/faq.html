          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Custom PC pricing varies based on your requirements. Gaming PCs typically start around $800, creator workstations around $1,200, and office systems around $500. We provide detailed quotes with component breakdowns so you know exactly what you're paying for. There are no hidden fees.</p>

            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Not necessarily. While our builds may cost similarly to premium prebuilts, you get higher quality components, no bloatware, proper cable management, stress testing, and local support. Cheap prebuilts often cut corners on power supplies, cooling, and storage — components that matter for longevity and performance.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, we're transparent about this. Our quotes show component costs and service fees separately. Service fees cover consultation, assembly, testing, OS installation, and support. For full-service deployments, additional services like on-site setup are itemized clearly.</p>

            <p>Yes, we require a 50% deposit before ordering parts, with the remaining balance due upon completion. For business deployments, we can discuss payment terms that work for your organization.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Most consumer builds are completed within 5-7 business days after parts arrive. Part availability can affect timing. Rush builds are available for an additional fee. Business deployments are scheduled based on project scope — we'll provide a timeline during consultation.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Absolutely. We offer assembly-only services for customers who have already purchased components. We'll verify compatibility and let you know if we spot any potential issues. Note that customer-supplied parts are covered by their original manufacturer warranties, not our labor warranty.</p>

            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, OS installation is included in our standard service. We install a clean copy of Windows (or Linux if preferred) with all necessary drivers and updates. We can also install your licensed software. You'll need to provide your own Windows license key, or we can include one in your quote.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Every system undergoes stress testing including CPU stress tests, GPU benchmarks, memory testing, and storage validation. We run these tests for extended periods to catch any stability issues. For business builds, we can also test with your specific software to ensure compatibility.</p>

            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We can accommodate changes before parts are ordered. Once parts are ordered, changes may incur restocking fees or additional costs. We recommend taking time to review your quote carefully before approval.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We provide a labor warranty on all builds (typically 30-90 days depending on the project type). This covers any issues related to assembly or configuration. All component parts retain their original manufacturer warranties (typically 2-5 years depending on the part), and we help coordinate warranty claims if issues arise.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We're still here to help. We offer paid diagnostic and repair services, and can assist with manufacturer warranty claims even after our labor warranty expires. Being local means you have ongoing support for the life of your system.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We focus on local service, which is where we provide the most value. Shipping PCs carries risk of damage and eliminates our ability to provide on-site support. For clients outside our service area, we can recommend reputable builders in your region.</p>

            <p>There's no strict minimum. We've helped businesses deploy as few as 2 workstations and as many as 50+. However, our full-service offering provides the most value for deployments of 3 or more systems where consistency and integration matter.</p>
